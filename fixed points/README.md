# Analysis on Fixed Points

Fixed_points.txt contains a list of in how many iterations every bar converges to one of the fixed points and for the bars that don't converge, what their first 10 generated bars look like.
Fixed_points_convergence.png contains a histogram, where on the x-axis each bar is seen as a binary number, represented in its decimal counterpart (e.g. [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1] is represented by 19) and the y axis counts how many bars converge to this bar. As we can see, none of the bars are repellors, but some are much more `popular' than others.
